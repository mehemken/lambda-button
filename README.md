# Mission statement

This is a simple repo that demonstrates how to trigger a lambda function (AWS) with an html submit button.

To run this setup, you'll need Python 3.6 and the packages Flask and FlaskWTF. The environment file included here contains all the dependencies needed to run with `$ python app.py`. However, you'll need the [Anaconda][1] distribution of Python and you'll need to know how to use [conda][2]. If you'd rather not do that just `pip install` Flask and FlaskWTF, you'll be fine.
